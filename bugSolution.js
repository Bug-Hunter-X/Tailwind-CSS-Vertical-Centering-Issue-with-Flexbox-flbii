```javascript
//In your template file, add explicit height to parent
<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen">
  <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Click Me
  </button>
</div>

//OR use a different approach such as grid for better control
<div class="grid place-items-center h-screen">
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Click Me
    </button>
</div>
```
This solution explicitly sets the parent div's height, ensuring that `items-center` has a defined space to work with.  The alternative `grid` approach offers another method for simpler vertical centering.
